```{r setup, include=FALSE}

### my_rf_cv

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
# setup function and data
source("../Code/my_rf_cv.R")
my_gapminder <- read.csv("../Data/my_gapminder.csv")
my_penguins <- read.csv("../Data/my_penguins.csv")
```

This function performs random forest k-fold cross-validation on `my_penguins`, with `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, and `flipper_length_mm` predicting `body_mass_g`. The following plots the Mean Squared Error of 30 Random Forest Simulations for each k-fold of 2, 5, 10.

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# create empty vectors
MSE <- c(rep(NA, 90))

j = 0
for (k in c(2, 5, 10)) {
  for (i in c(1:30)) {
    # calculate MSE for random forest
    MSE[j + i] <- my_rf_cv(k)
  }
  j = j + 30
}
# track the group
rf_group <- c(rep(2, 30), rep(5, 30), rep(10, 30))
rf_group <- as.factor(rf_group)
rf_results <- data.frame(k = rf_group, MSE = MSE)

# plot the box plot of the errors
plot <- ggplot(data = rf_results, mapping = aes(x = k, y = MSE)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of MSE for 30 Random Forest Simulations per k-fold") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
# save plot
ggsave("../Output/Figures/rf_MSE.png", plot = plot)

plot
```

```{r}
# modify data
a <- subset(rf_results, k == 2)
b <- subset(rf_results, k == 5)
c <- subset(rf_results, k == 10)
results <- cbind(a$MSE, b$MSE, c$MSE)
colnames(results) <- c(2, 5, 10)
# save data
write.csv(results, file = "../Output/Results/simulations.csv")
```

We can also find the mean and standard deviation of these k-fold groups.

```{r}
# create matrix
rf_stat <- matrix(nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
colnames(rf_stat) <- c("mean", "Sd. dev")
rownames(rf_stat) <- as.character(c(2, 5, 10))
for (i in c(2, 5, 10)) {
  # filter by k group
  dat <- subset(rf_results, k == i)
  # get the mean
  rf_stat[as.character(i) ,"mean"] <- mean(dat$MSE)
  # get st dev
  rf_stat[as.character(i) ,"Sd. dev"] <- sd(dat$MSE)
}
rf_stats <- as.table(rf_stat)
# save table
saveRDS(rf_stats, file = "../Output/Results/summary.rds")
rf_stats
```

Based on the results, we can see that the mean cross-validation errors are similar across all k, but more variable when k is lower. For the means, the error is slightly higher among lower k-values, likely because there's less training data with less k-folds, but this difference isn't significant. However, the standard deviation is much higher with lower k, as there are less Mean Squared Errors to average when k is low, leading to more variance in the data.
